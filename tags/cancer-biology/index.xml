      <description>The TCGA project combined DNA sequence data from three centers generated at Broad, Baylor, and Washington University. Mutation calling was performed independently at one or more of these centers for each of the tumor specific marker papers. The methods used for mutation calling varied as the project evolved over the years. The TCGA PanCancer Atlas MC3 set is a re-calling of uniform files to remove batch effects and enable pancancer analysis.</description>
