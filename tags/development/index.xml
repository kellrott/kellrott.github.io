      <description>Handling Failures from OpenStack Swift in Funnel When building distributed services, handling failures from other services is a fact of life.
We use OpenStack Swift as our object storage service, and we use Funnel to transfer thousands of objects to and from Swift. Failed transfers have been common; the Swift server ca be unavailable, overloaded, and even lose chunks of data during upload.
It’s been challenging to make Funnel tolerant to all these failures, improved our logs and tools available for debugging, improved our code, and we’ve learned a lot along the way.</description>
