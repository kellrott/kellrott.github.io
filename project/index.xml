      <description>The NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-Space (AnVIL) is a project to build a data commons to allow researchers to efficiently analyze and visualize genomics data on the cloud. This project is a collaboration with Oregon Health and Science University, University of California Santa Cruz, University of Chicago, The Broad Institute, Washington University in St. Louis, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Johns Hopkins University and Pennsylvania State University.</description>

      <description>The BioMedical Evidence Graph (BMEG) integrates different types of biomedical data into a unified graph for efficient application of machine learning and discovery algorithms across heterogeneous data types. BMEG will leverage the petabytes of genomics data available for tumor samples from repositories like the National Cancer Instituteâ€™s Genomic Data Commons to predict drug sensitivity, patient outcomes, and other clinically relevant phenotypes. The BMEG data model is instantiated in a scalable graph database optimized for storing and querying graphs containing terabytes of vertices and edges distributed across a multi-machine cluster.</description>

The ICGC-TCGA DREAM Genomic Mutation Calling Challenge (herein, The Challenge) is an international effort to improve standard methods for identifying cancer-associated mutations and rearrangements in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. Leaders of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer genomics projects are joining with Sage Bionetworks and IBM-DREAM to initiate this innovative open crowd-sourced Challenge.</description>

Funnel is a toolkit for distributed task execution with a simple API.
A task describes metadata, state, input/output files, resource requests, commands, and logs. The task API has four actions: create, get, list, and cancel. Given a task, Funnel will queue it, schedule it to a worker, and track its state and logs. A worker will download input files, run a sequence of Docker containers, upload output files, and emits events and logs along the way.</description>

      <description>The TCGA project combined DNA sequence data from three centers generated at Broad, Baylor, and Washington University. Mutation calling was performed independently at one or more of these centers for each of the tumor specific marker papers. The methods used for mutation calling varied as the project evolved over the years. The TCGA PanCancer Atlas MC3 set is a re-calling of uniform files to remove batch effects and enable pancancer analysis.</description>
