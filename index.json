We developed neoepiscope chiefly to address this issue for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (indels). RESULTS: Herein, we illustrate how germline and somatic variant phasing affects neoepitope prediction across multiple datasets.

Structural variants can initiate tumors, enhance their aggressiveness, and provide unique therapeutic opportunities. Whole-genome sequencing of tumors can allow exhaustive identification of the specific structural variants present in an individual cancer, facilitating both clinical diagnostics and the discovery of novel mutagenic mechanisms. A plethora of somatic structural variant detection algorithms have been created to enable these discoveries; however, there are no systematic benchmarks of them. Rigorous performance evaluation of somatic structural variant detection methods has been challenged by the lack of gold standards, extensive resource requirements, and difficulties arising from the need to share personal genomic information. RESULTS: To facilitate structural variant detection algorithm evaluations, we create a robust simulation framework for somatic structural variants by extending the BAMSurgeon algorithm. We then organize and enable a crowdsourced benchmarking within the ICGC-TCGA DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling Challenge (SMC-DNA). We report here the results of structural variant benchmarking on three different tumors, comprising 204 submissions from 15 teams. In addition to ranking methods, we identify characteristic error profiles of individual algorithms and general trends across them. Surprisingly, we find that ensembles of analysis pipelines do not always outperform the best individual method, indicating a need for new ways to aggregate somatic structural variant detection approaches. CONCLUSIONS: The synthetic tumors and somatic structural variant detection leaderboards remain available as a community benchmarking resource, and BAMSurgeon is available at https://github.com/adamewing/bamsurgeon .","tags":null,"title":"Combining accurate tumor genome simulation with crowdsourcing to benchmark somatic structural variant detection.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex Buchanan"],"categories":[],"content":"Handling Failures from OpenStack Swift in Funnel When building distributed services, handling failures from other services is a fact of life.\nWe use OpenStack Swift as our object storage service, and we use Funnel to transfer thousands of objects to and from Swift. Failed transfers have been common; the Swift server ca be unavailable, overloaded, and even lose chunks of data during upload.\nIt’s been challenging to make Funnel tolerant to all these failures, improved our logs and tools available for debugging, improved our code, and we’ve learned a lot along the way.\nRetries At the core of handling failures is being able to retry failed requests.\nIn Funnel, we retry most failed requests to external services. We do this by wrapping our APIs in a generic utility which can replay the same request until it succeeds. For example,\n// Storage is the interface we want to wrap. type Storage interface { Put(sourcePath, destURL string) error } // NewStorageRetrier creates a wrapper around Storage which includes retry logic. func NewStorageRetrier(backend Storage) *StorageRetrier { return StorageRetrier{ Backend: backend, Retrier: util.Retrier{ // At first, retry after one second. InitialInterval: time.Second, // Each successive retry will wait twice as long before retrying. Multiplier: 2.0, // Retry for up to an hour. MaxElapsedTime: 60*time.Minute, // ShouldRetry decides whether the error can be retried. ShouldRetry: func(err error) bool { switch err { // Retry if the uploaded object isn\u0026#39;t the same, // the service is unavailable, etc. case swift.ObjectCorrupted, swift.TimeoutError, swift.UnavailableError: return true default: return false } }, }, } } The code here is simplified for this post, the real code is here.\nOur storage code will now attempt to upload the file multiple times until it succeeds. Funnel will try hard to upload, retrying for up to an hour.\nTesting The hard part about debugging failures is that they are often intermittent and difficult to reproduce.\nSetting up a system which can deterministically reproduce specific types of failures takes some work, but it can be very useful and may be worth the price of admission.\nLuckily, there are tools out there to help.\ntoxy toxy is a proxy server which can be configured to inject errors into network traffic.\nvar toxy = require(\u0026#39;toxy\u0026#39;) var poisons = toxy.poisons var rules = toxy.rules var proxy = toxy() // Forward traffic to the actual Swift server proxy.forward(\u0026#39;http://swift.actual:8080\u0026#39;) // Inject \u0026#34;Object corrupted\u0026#34; errors into uploads, // which happens when the uploaded object doesn\u0026#39;t match // the file being uploaded (meaning something got lost). proxy .put(\u0026#39;/*/buchanan/funnel-test/object-corrupted\u0026#39;) .poison(poisons.inject({ code: 200, // Change the object\u0026#39;s etag (checksum) in the response to the PUT. // // This is how swift communicates to the client the checksum of the // object that was uploaded, so we force it to be corrupt here. headers: {\u0026#39;ETag\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;zzzzzzzzzf1a4e663f02245d42832766\u0026#39;} })) // Only corrupt the object 60% of the time. .withRule(rules.probability(60)) // Simulate the service being unavailable. proxy .all(\u0026#39;/*/buchanan/funnel-test/service-unavailable\u0026#39;) .poison(poisons.inject({ code: 503, body: \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;toxy injected error\u0026#34;}\u0026#39;, headers: {\u0026#39;Content-Type\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;application/json\u0026#39;} })) .withRule(rules.probability(60)) proxy.all(\u0026#34;/*\u0026#34;) proxy.listen(8000) The code above will proxy Swift traffic, injecting errors into traffic 60% of the time.\nThe failures can be accessed by pointing Funnel’s Swift client to this proxy, and uploading to a specific object URL:\nexport FUNNEL_SWIFT_STORAGE_URL=http://fake.swift:8000/v1/AUTH_abcedfg funnel storage put swift://buchanan/funnel-test/service-unavailable Now we can tweak the proxy errors and fix Funnel code at the same time, easily working out the kinks in error handling, and having confidence that Funnel is retrying requests correctly.\nRetry screenshot\ntcpdump tcpdump allows you to monitor network traffic and inspect low-level packets.

This working group would eventually evolve into Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium VICC.\nMany of the ideas and goals changed of the project changed over the years. Below is the original whitepaper draft, to show how much the project has evolved.\nGA4GH Genotypes to Phenotypes (G2P) Task Team Motivation One of the most important goals driving the collection of genome sequence information is to understand how particular variants lead to observable phenotypes and treatment options. Yet no standards exist on how to describe genotype to phenotype (G2P) relationships. Several databases exist that have begun to collect G2P information such as PharmGKB, my cancer genome, MD Anderson’s personalized therapy knowledge base, ClinVar, SNPeff, OMIM, and the Human Gene Mutation Database. However, it is not possible to compare or aggregate data from these disparate sources because each use their own terminologies. Additionally, prediction of G2P relationships is an extremely active research area, with thousands of papers proposing novel signatures, biomarkers, and mathematical models to predict a given phenotype, and multiple crowd-sourced challenges soliciting thousands of models from the community around G2P problems such as prediction of breast cancer prognosis, response to rheumatoid arthritis therapy, and sensitivity of cancer cell lines to small molecular or shRNA treatments. Because no standards exist for representing such computationally derived predictions, it is difficult to compare the accuracy of different predictors for a given problem, leading to inconsistency and lack of clarity regarding bona-fide predictive signatures, and models trained on a given dataset are not easily applied to G2P prediction in related datasets, making it difficult to assess robustness or gain knowledge of signatures related to multiple phenotypes.\nOther GA4GH working groups are creating standards for representing and computing on genetic and clinical (phenotype) data. We aim to build on and connect the work of these GA4GH groups, by defining standard data representations and building out a computable resource of G2P relationships. Formally, G2P relations may be described as a triple (see Goals for the API Specification) with Genotype(G), Phenotype(P) and Connection(C). Other GA4GH groups are defining standards for G and P, while our group will define standards for C.\nA successful, long-term implementation would be able to represent G2P relationships derived from multiple sources, including those approved for clinical actionability, derived from the literature, or inferred from data analysis. This implementation would also represent both simple G2P relationships associated with a single genetic variant, as well as more complex G2P relationships in which phenotype is defined as a multi-variate function incorporating multiple omics data types and prior knowledge, such as pathway relationships.\nDriving Pilot Projects We propose pilot projects that initially implement the simpler use case (literature-derived, single variant relationships) while building up towards the more complex use case of computationally-derived multi-variate relationships.\nProject 1. Extract genotype-to-phenotype information from the literature. Our first driving project will build both the representation standards and initial implementation of a publicly available clinical genomics database derived from literature-based associations between a genetic variant and a phenotype. We will initially focus on cancer genetic variants linked to therapeutic response. We will then expand to represent genetic variants corresponding to risk or diagnostic markers of non-cancer genetic diseases.\nMany efforts at cancer centers across the world are now focusing on developing a clinical genomics database to guide precision medicine treatment decisions. Therefore, we believe a GA4GH initiative could be of great benefit to the community, by defining standards to create compatibility across these multiple efforts, and creating an open community resource that will eliminate redundancy across efforts.\nOur group will include leaders of prominent clinical genomics efforts, including: Gordon Mills, who leads MDAnderson’s personalized cancer therapy initiative (https://pct.mdanderson.org/); Chris Corless, who leads the Knight Diagnostic Lab at OHSU, and Rodrigo Dienstmann, who created the clinical genomics database for Massachussets General Hostpital.

As detailed on this wikipage, the TCGA MC3dataset represents a uniform set of mutation calls. The BAM files used underwent a standardized local re-alignment to hg19 (Genome Reference Consortium GRCh37), six calling algorithms were applied, and a number of automated filters were applied.

Benchmarking is needed for tool assessment and improvement but is complicated by a lack of gold standards, by extensive resource requirements and by difficulties in sharing personal genomic information. To resolve these issues, we launched the ICGC-TCGA DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling Challenge, a crowdsourced benchmark of somatic mutation detection algorithms. Here we report the BAMSurgeon tool for simulating cancer genomes and the results of 248 analyses of three in silico tumors created with it. Different algorithms exhibit characteristic error profiles, and, intriguingly, false positives show a trinucleotide profile very similar to one found in human tumors. Although the three simulated tumors differ in sequence contamination (deviation from normal cell sequence) and in subclonality, an ensemble of pipelines outperforms the best individual pipeline in all cases. BAMSurgeon is available at https://github.com/adamewing/bamsurgeon/.
